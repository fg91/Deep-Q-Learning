    "## 1. Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "In supervised learning a neural network, for instance, learns a function that maps an input to a corresponding output/target on the basis of a large amount of labeled training data consisting of example input-output pairs: Simply put, if you train a neural network to classify, for example, cats and dogs, you repeatedly show the network pictures of cats or dogs, compare the network's prediction to the label and slightly adapt the network's parameters until the neural net is able to classify what animal is shown in a picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's say you let a child play a computer game it has never played before. In the case of [Breakout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmPfTpjtdgg) the player sees the pixel screen as input and has to decide whether to move left or right. You could certainly show the child many times in which situations it has to press left and in which situations right in order to win the game (supervised learning) but surely the child would become bored quickly and would try to push you aside, wanting to try the game itself. And the child would learn to play the game quickly without being told how to do so simply by evaluating which actions lead to an increased score. In reinforcement learning we try to make a computer learn in this exact same way, by letting it explore the environment and occasionally giving it a reward when the score increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, in comparison to supervised learning, this poses a problem. On p. 1 of [Mnih et al. 2013](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602) the authors say:\n",
    "\n",
    ">RL algorithms [...] must be able to learn from a scalar reward signal that is frequently sparse [...] and delayed. The delay between actions and resulting rewards, which can be thousands of timesteps long, seems particularly daunting when compared to the direct association between inputs and targets found in supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do the authors mean with with \"sparse [...] and delayed\"? \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you walk through a maze trying to find treasures. You get a reward once you find gold. Now imagine you encounter a fork in the path. Which way do you take? As opposed to supervised learning, at the fork the agent does not get any immediate feedback/reward for taking the right path but only later once it finds any gold. Yet it might have been crucial to take for example the left way at the fork. This is what the authors mean with *delayed*. The problem is met by discounting future rewards with a factor $\\gamma$ (between 0 and 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "[Sutton and Barto 2018](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xeUDVGWGUUv1-ccUMAZHJLej2C7aAFWY/view) write on page 55:\n",
    "\n",
    ">The additional concept that we need is that of discounting. According to this approach,\n",
    "the agent tries to select actions so that the sum of the discounted rewards it receives over\n",
    "the future is maximized. In particular, it chooses $A_t$ to maximize the *expected discounted\n",
    "return*:\n",
    "\n",
    "The discounted return $G_t$ is calculated as follows  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "G_{t} &= R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\gamma^2 R_{t+3} + ... \\\\\n",
    "&=R_{t+1} + \\gamma \\bigl(R_{t+2} + \\gamma R_{t+3} + ...\\bigr)\\\\\n",
    "&= R_{t+1} + \\gamma G_{t+1}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R_t$ is the reward the agent received at time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors furthermore explain:\n",
    "\n",
    ">a reward received $k$ time steps in the future is worth only $\\gamma^{k−1}$ times what it would be worth if it were received immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    ">As $\\gamma$ approaches 1, the return objective takes future rewards into account more strongly; the agent becomes more farsighted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us look at a very simple example where there is just one reward not equal to 0 (calculate from right to left):\n",
    "\n",
    "time $t$ |  0| 1 | 2|3|4|\n",
    ":---| --- | ---| ---|---|---|\n",
    "reward sequence $R_t$|  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "discounted returns $G_t$| $\\gamma^3$ | $\\gamma^2$ | $\\gamma$ | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "for $\\gamma=0.9$|0.729 | 0.81 | 0.9| 1 |0|\n",
    "\n",
    "Minor detail: In this example there is no reward at $t=0$ because the first reward $R_1$ is a result of action $a_0$ taken in state $s_0$ and the reward is always associated with the next state in Sutton and Barto. Some articles associate the reward $R_i$ with the state $s_i$ and action $a_i$ that caused the reward. In that case the definition of the discounted return changes to $G_t=R_{t} + \\gamma G_{t+1}$, in the table the 1's would all be in the same column and there would be a reward equal to 0 at $t=0$ but not at $t=4$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, by discounting returns, future rewards increase past or current returns and the closer $\\gamma$ is to 1, the farther the agent can *see* into the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "And *sparse*?\n",
    "In our fictive maze example, the rewards are the sparser, the less gold you find. For an agent, a game is more difficult to learn, the sparser the reward is. [Pong](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Pong-v0/) is one of the games DQN can learn fastest because the score changes quite often. [Montezuma's Revenge](https://gym.openai.com/envs/MontezumaRevenge-v0/), on the other hand, has very sparse rewards and DQN (at least without some additional tricks) is not able to learn the game at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Q-Learning\n",
    "So how does Q-Learning work? If the agent (regardless if trained or still untrained) is shown a state $s$ of the game, it has to decide which action $a$ to perform (for example move paddle left or right in breakout). How does it do that? On page 2 [Mnih et al. 2013](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602) define the so-called $Q$-Function:\n",
    ">We define the optimal action-value function $Q^∗(s, a)$ as the maximum expected return achievable by following any strategy, after seeing some sequence $s$ and then taking some action $a$ \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that given a state of the game $s$ (for now please consider *sequences* as states of the game), $Q^*(s,a)$ is the best (discounted) total return the agent can achieve if it performs action $a$ in the current state $s$. So how does it choose which action to perform assuming we already know $Q^*(s,a)$? One obvious strategy would be to always choose the action with the maximum value of $Q^*$ (we will see later, why this is slightly problematic). But first of all, we need to find this magical function $Q^*$:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we are in state $s$, decide to perform action $a$ and arrive in the next state $s'$. If we assume that in state $s'$ the $Q^*$-values for all possible actions $a'$ were already known, then the $Q^*$-value in state $s$ for action $a$ (action-value in $s$ for action $a$) would be the reward $r$ we got for performing action $a$ plus the discounted maximum future return in $s'$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "Q^*(s,a) = r + \\gamma \\textrm{max}\\left( Q^*(s',a') \\right)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Less formal but more intuitive:\n",
    "If we were at a certain fork in the maze (state $s$) and want to know how good it was to choose the left path (perform action $a$), we add the gold we found after going left (reward we received for performing action $a$) and the amount of gold we expect to find down the road (maximum future discounted return). If you have to choose between finding a golden coin immediately after going left at a fork but nothing else down the road or finding nothing immediatley after going right but a treasure down the road, well, the right path is worth more/has a higher action-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the so-called **Bellman equation**. Deep Q-Learning uses a neural network to find an approximation $Q(s,a,\\theta)$ of $Q^*(s,a)$. $\\theta$ are the parameters of the neural network. We will discuss later, how exactly the parameters of the network are updated. Now, I will explain to you, how the neural network maps a state $s$ to $Q$-values for the possible actions $a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier I mentioned, that I regard a *sequence* as a *state*. What did I mean with that? Imagine you have a pin-sharp image of a flying soccer ball. Can you tell in which direction it moves? No, you cannot, but you could if there was some kind of motion blur in the picture or if you had several images taken quickly one after another showing the ball in a slightly different position every time. The same problem occurs in Atari games. From a single frame of the game [Pong](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Pong-v0/), the agent can not discern in which direction the ball moves. DeepMind met this problem by stacking several consecutive frames and considering this sequence a state that is passed to the neural network. From such a sequence the agent is able to detect the direction and speed of movement because the ball is in a different position in each frame.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Since the agent only observes images of the current screen [...] it is impossible to fully understand the current situation from only the current screen $x_t$. We therefore consider sequences of actions and observations, $s_t = x_1, a_1, x_2, ..., a_{t−1}, x_t$, and learn game strategies that depend upon these sequences. All sequences in the emulator are assumed to terminate in a finite number of time-steps. This formalism gives rise to a large but finite Markov decision process (MDP) in which each sequence is a distinct state. ([page 2 of Mnih et al. 2013](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602))\n",
    "\n",
    "You should defenitely understand what a [Markov decision process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process) and a [Markov chain\n",
    "](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) is, they are fundamental to reinforcement learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "On page 5 of [Mnih et al. 2013](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602) the authors explain the preprocessing of the frames:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Working directly with raw Atari frames, which are 210 × 160 pixel images with a 128 color palette, can be computationally demanding, so we apply a basic preprocessing step aimed at reducing the input dimensionality. The raw frames are preprocessed by first converting their RGB representation to gray-scale and down-sampling it to a 110×84 image. The final input representation is obtained by cropping an 84 × 84 region of the image that roughly captures the playing area. The final cropping stage is only required because we use the GPU implementation of 2D convolutions from [...], which expects square inputs. For the experiments in this paper, the function $\\phi$ [...] applies this preprocessing to the last 4 frames of a history and stacks them to produce the input to the $Q$-function.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let us start by looking at how the preprocessing can be implemented. I used `gym` from OpenAi to provide the environment. A frame returned by the environment has the shape `(210,160,3)` where the 3 stands for the RGB color channels. Such a frame is passed to the method `process` which transforms it to a `(84,84,1)` frame, where the 1 indicates that instead of three RGB channels there is one grayscale channel. \n"

On page 2 of [Wang et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06581) the authors explain:\n",
    "\n",

Before implementing it myself, I tried the Adam optimizer which gave promising results without much hyperparameter-search. Adam was not invented when [Mnih et al. 2013](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602) was published, so one could argue that they might have used it instead of RMSProp if it had been invented earlier. On the other hand, the authors of this [blog post](https://blog.paperspace.com/intro-to-optimization-momentum-rmsprop-adam/) compare *Momentum, RMSProp and Adam* and argue:\n",
    ">Out of the above three, you may find momentum to be the most prevalent, despite Adam looking the most promising on paper. Empirical results have shown that all these algorithms can converge to different optimal local minima given the same loss. However, SGD with momentum seems to find more flatter minima than Adam, while adaptive methods tend to converge quickly towards sharper minima. Flatter minima generalize better than sharper ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe some of these differences might be mitigated by the use of *AdamW*, which I described [in this blog post](https://medium.com/@fabiograetz/why-adamw-matters-736223f31b5d) (irrelevant for DQN since no regularization is used). For now, I stick with Adam and if I find some time in the future, I might come back to this since it might be well worth spending some time on playing with different optimizers and implementing the version of RMSProp used by DeepMind. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Edit*: In a later DeepMind paper called \"Rainbow: Combining Improvements in Deep Reinforcement Learning\" by [Hessel et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02298) RMSProp was substituted for Adam with a learning rate of 0.0000625 (see Table 1). This learning rate is close to what I found working well for Breakout (0.00001) before reading Hessel et al. 2017.\n",

    "If you compare the dueling architecture described above to the network implemented in the next cell, you will find a small difference. Instead of two hidden fully connected layers with 512 rectifier units for each, the value and the advantage stream, I ended up adding a fourth convolutional layer with 1024 filters. The output has the shape (1, 1, 1024) and is then split into two streams with shapes (1, 1, 512). This architecture is suggested [here](https://github.com/awjuliani/DeepRL-Agents/blob/master/Double-Dueling-DQN.ipynb) and after performing some tests on the environment Pong, which is comparably easy to learn for a DQN agent, I find that this small adjustment lets the reward increase slightly earlier and higher."

    ">We also found it helpful to clip the error term from the update [...] to be between -1 and 1. Because the absolute value loss function |x| has a derivative of -1 for all negative values of x and a derivative of 1 for all positive values of x, clipping the squared error to be between -1 and 1 corresponds to using an absolute value loss function for errors outside of the (-1,1) interval. This form of error clipping further improved the stability of the algorithm.\n",

    ">In deep networks or recurrent neural networks, error gradients can accumulate during an update and result in very large gradients. These in turn result in large updates to the network weights, and in turn, an unstable network. At an extreme, the values of weights can become so large as to overflow and result in NaN values. [Source](https://machinelearningmastery.com/exploding-gradients-in-neural-networks/)\n",

    "If you look at the code in the previous cell, you will find, that we are now able to predict the action, the network considers best (`self.best_action`) by taking the argument of the maximum $Q$-value. But initially, the agent does not know how to play the game. If we always exploit and never explore by always chosing the action with the highest $Q$-value (greedy), the agent will stick to the first strategy it discovers that returns a small reward. It can then not continue exploring the environment and can not continue to learn. The $\\epsilon$-greedy algorithm offers a simple solution for that problem: Simply put, we usually chose the action the networks deems best but with a probability of $\\epsilon$ we chose a random action. $\\epsilon$ is a function of the number of frames the agent has seen. For the first 50000 frames the agent only explores ($\\epsilon=1$). Over the following 1 million frames, $\\epsilon$ is linearly decreased to 0.1, meaning that the agent starts exploiting more and more. DeepMind then keeps $\\epsilon=0.1$, however, we chose to decrease it to $\\epsilon=0.01$ over the remaining frames as suggested by the [OpenAi Baselines for DQN](https://blog.openai.com/openai-baselines-dqn/) (in the plot the maximum number of frames is 2 million for demonstration purposes).\n",

    ">Second, learning directly from consecutive samples is inefficient, due to the strong correlations between the samples; randomizing the samples breaks these correlations and therefore reduces the variance of the updates. Third, when learning on-policy the current parameters determine the next data sample that the parameters are trained on. For example, if the maximizing action is to move left then the training samples will be dominated by samples from the left-hand side; if the maximizing action then switches to the right then the training distribution will also switch. It is easy to see how unwanted feedback loops may arise and the parameters could get stuck in a poor local minimum, or even diverge catastrophically. ([page 5 of Mnih et al. 2013](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602))\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that when we choose an action and perform a step to receive a reward, the network does not learn from this last step but rather adds the transition to the replay memory. It then draws a random minibatch from the replay memory to perform a gradient descent step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The replay memory stores the last one million transitions. Let's recall that a transition is `[state, action, reward, terminal, new_state]`. We therefore need to store the last one million `state`, `action`, `reward`, `terminal` and `new_state`. If you remember that `state` and `new_state` are four frames each, that would be eight million frames. However, since `new_state` is created by stacking the newest frame on top of `state` and deleting the oldest frame, `new_state` and `state` share three frames. Furthermore, `new_state` of transition i will be `state` of transition i+1. This means that it is sufficient to store the last one million frames (84*84 pixels) as a (1 million, 84, 84) tensor and then slicing four frames out of this tensor when we need a `state` or `new_state`. \n",
    "\n",
    "With one million frames of 84 by 84 pixels that need to be stored in your computers memory, we need to consider in what datatype we store them. The environment returns frames with pixel values stored as `uint8` which can have values ranging from 0 to 255. A `uint8` needs 8 bits. The network expects a `tf.float32` input with pixel values between 0 and 1 (which takes four times more space than a `uint8`). Since we want to reduce the memory requirements, we store the frames in `uint8` and divide them by 255 before passing them to the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing this version of replay memory, we looked at this [code](https://github.com/tambetm/simple_dqn/blob/master/src/replay_memory.py) and ended up implementing the replay memory with some adjustments that make the code more understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the `ReplayMemory` class below. In the constructor, we pre-allocate the memory for the frames, the actions, the rewards, the terminal states and also for the states and new states of the minibatch. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the `add_experience` method the frames etc. are written into `self.frames` at index `self.current` which is then increased by 1. When `self.current` reaches the size of the replay memory (one million), it is reset to zero to overwrite the oldest frames. The method `_get_state` slices four frames out of `self.frames` and returns them as a `state`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what the method `_get_valid_indices` does, we need to understand what an invalid index is. We store all frames the agent sees in `self.frames`. When a game terminates (`terminal=True`) at index i, frame at index i belongs to a different episode than the frame at i+1. We want to avoid creating a `state` with frames from two different episodes. The same thing can happen at the index `self.current`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, before `self.count` once reaches the size of the replay memory, we need to make sure that an index is not smaller than the number of frames stacked toghether to create a `state` (`self.agent_history_length=4`), so that a `state` and `new_state` can be sliced out of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method `_get_valid_indices` finds 32 (size of minibatch) valid indices.\n",
    "The method `get_minibatch` returns the transitions for those indices.

    "Why do we need two networks, the action-value function and the *target* action-value function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that prior to updating the network's parameters, we draw a minibatch with 32 transitions. For simplicity we consider one transition now. It consists of a `state`, an `action` that was performed in the `state`, the received `reward`, the `new_state` and a bool saying whether the episode is over.\n",
    "\n",
    "We perform a gradient descent step:\n",
    "The main network looks at state and estimates the $Q_\\text{prediction}$-values that say how good each action is. However, we want the $Q$-values to follow the Bellman equation we introduced above. Therefore we calculate the $Q_\\text{target}$-values according to the Bellman equation (how we would like the $Q$-values to be) and then compare the estimates $Q_\\text{prediction}$ to the targets $Q_\\text{target}$. Let's consider the quadratic loss function instead of the Huber loss function for simplicity:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "L = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(Q_\\text{prediction} - Q_\\text{target}\\right)^2\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that we regress the current $Q_\\text{prediction}$-values for `state` towards the $Q_\\text{target}$-values given by the Bellman equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$Q_\\text{prediction}$ is calculated in the `DQN` class (`self.q_values`). $Q_\\text{prediction}$ depends on the current `state` in the minibatch we drew and on the parameters $\\theta$ of the network that estimates it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $Q_\\text{target}$ value is calculated according to the Bellman equation. It is the sum of the immediate reward $r$ received for performing action $a$ in state $s$ (`action` and `state` from the minibatch) and the maximum $Q$-value over all possible actions $a'$ in $s'$ (`new_state` from the minibatch):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "Q_\\text{target}(s,a) = r + \\gamma \\textrm{max} \\left(Q(s',a')\\right)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not done in the `DQN` class but in the `learn` method below. The calculated value is then passed to the placeholder called `self.target_q` in the `DQN` class. There, the loss function is defined and the gradient descent step is performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, now that we understand how the parameters are updated, why use two networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that both $Q_\\text{prediction}$ and $Q_\\text{target}$ depend on the same parameters $\\theta$ if only one network is used. This can lead to instability when regressing $Q_\\text{prediction}$ towards $Q_\\text{target}$ because the \"target is moving\". We ensure a \"fixed target\" by introducing a second network with fixed and only occasionally updated parameters that estimates the target $Q$-values.\n",
    "\n",
    "On page 1 of [Mnih et al. 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236/) the authors explain:\n",
    ">Reinforcement learning is known to be unstable or even to diverge when a nonlinear function approximator such as a neural network is used to represent the action-value (also known as Q) function. This instability has several causes: the correlations present in the sequence of observations, the fact that small updates to Q may significantly change the policy and therefore change the data distribution, and the correlations between the action-values [...] and the target values [...].\n",
    "We address these instabilities with a novel variant of Q-learning, which uses two key ideas. First, we used a biologically inspired mechanism termed experience replay that randomizes over the data, thereby removing correlations in the observation sequence and smoothing over changes in the data distribution [...]. Second, we used an iterative update that adjusts the action-values (Q) towards target values that are only periodically updated, thereby reducing correlations with the target. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore they used one network to predict the $Q_\\text{prediction}$-value and the other fixed network to predict the $Q_\\text{target}$-value. The main network is optimized during the gradient descend step and every 10000 steps the main network's parameters are copied to the target network. Be aware that the network update frequency is measured in the number of chosen actions/frames seen (DeepMind code) and not the number of parameter updates which occur every four frames ([Mnih et al. 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one additional very powerful improvement called *Double Q-Learning*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Double Q-Learning\n",
    "DQN has been observed to estimate unrealistically high $Q$-values. The reason for this is, that the Bellman equation *includes a maximization step over estimated action values, which tends to prefer overestimated to underestimated values* (see [van Hasselt et al. 2016, page 1](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI16/paper/download/12389/11847)). \n",
    "\n",
    "The authors explain:\n",
    "\n",
    ">If all values would be uniformly higher then the relative action preferences are preserved and we would not expect the resulting policy to be any worse. [...]\n",
    "If, however, the overestimations are not uniform and not concentrated at states about which we wish to learn more, then they might negatively affect the quality of the resulting policy. [...]\n",
    "We then show that this algorithm not only yields more accurate value estimates, but leads to much higher scores on several games. This demonstrates that the overestimations of DQN were indeed leading to poorer policies and that it is beneficial to reduce them \n",
    "\n",
    "The estimated $Q$-values are noisy. Assume that the true $Q$-value is 0 for all actions. But because of the noisy estimation, some $Q$-values might be slightly positive, others slightly negative. The max operation in the Bellman equation will however always chose the small positive values, despite the fact, that those actions are not truly better. The estimatation of $Q$-values is thus biased towards larger values. How do we fix this?\n",
    "Instead of estimating the $Q$-values in the next state $Q(s',a')$ with only the target network, we use the main network to estimate which action is the best and then ask the target network how high the $Q$-value is for that action. This way, the main network will still prefer the action with the small positive $Q$-value but because of the noisy estimation, the target network will predict a small positive **or** small negative $Q$-value for that action and on average, the predicted $Q$-values will be closer to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the reason for the overestimation is, that the expectation of a maximum is greater than or equal to the maximum of an expectation [van Hasselt 2013, Theorem 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.7175).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bellman equation changes from\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "Q_\\text{target}(s,a) &= r + \\gamma \\textrm{max} Q(s',a';\\theta_\\text{target}) &\\text{Normal DQN}\\\\\n",
    "\\text{to}\\qquad\\qquad Q_\\text{target}(s,a) &= r + \\gamma Q\\left(s',a'=\\text{argmax} Q(s',a';\\theta_\\text{main});\\theta_\\text{target}\\right)&\\text{Double DQN}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The main network estimates which action $a'$ (in the next state $s'$) is best (that is the $\\text{argmax} Q(s',a';\\theta_\\text{main})$ part). The target network then estimates what the $Q$-value for that action is. This $Q$-value has to be discounted with $\\gamma$ and is then added to the reward $r$ the agent got for action $a$ (not $a'$).\n",
    "\n",
    "I know that this equation might look discouraging. So let's describe it again in words:\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal DQN: Ask the target network for the highest $Q$-Value. If the noisy $Q$-values are for example $(0.1,-0.1)$ for actions with index $0$ and $1$ respectively, the target $Q$-network will answer $0.1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Double DQN: Ask the main network which action has the highest $Q$-value. If the noisy $Q$-values are for example $(0.1,-0.1)$ for actions with index $0$ and $1$ respectively, the main network will answer that action with index $0$ has the highest $Q$-value. Then we ask the target network, which has a different noise, what the $Q$-value for the action with the chosen index ($0$ in this example) is. Let's assume the target network's noisy estimates are $(-0.05,0.3)$ it will answer $-0.05$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This solves the problem of overestimated $Q$-values because the two networks have different noise and the bias towards slightly larger noisy $Q$-values cancels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One more thing:\n",
    "If the game is over (`terminal=True`) because the agend lost or won, there is no next state and the $Q_\\text{target}$-value is simply the reward $r$.\n",

    "You will see, that there is no punishment (reward is 0) when a life is lost. It helps the agent tremendously avoiding losing a life if you consider loss of life as end of episode. However, we only do this in the replay memory as we do not want to reset the game once the first life is lost. Therefore two terminal states `terminal` and `terminal_life_lost` are needed, one to reset the game, the other for the replay memory. This adjustment helped the agent improve from an average reward slightly above 50 to approximately 140 in Breakout! \n",

[Mnih et al. 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236/) use a random number between 1 and 30 of 'NOOP'-actions (see page 10, Table 1). However, in Breakout, nothing happens if you don't fire first. Once there is a ball in the game, 'FIRE' does nothing. Therefore I started with a random number of 'FIRE'-actions. Furthermore, I limited the random number of initial 'FIRE' actions to 10. When experimenting with larger numbers, I found, that the first life was usually already lost when the agent starting moving. You might want to change this, in case you want to experiment with another environment."
